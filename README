A very simple script using MatLab's Computer Vision libraries

Specifically designed to convert an existing 3-part grayscale Prokudin-Gorskii image into a new color image

Divides an input into 3 sections (assumes all three Prokudin-Gorskii slates are in one vertical column in the first image)
Requires manual input by the user to first select 2 small features in the red and green spectrum sections of the input
A final prompt is made to select a subset in the image containing the features previous selected

Automatically aligns images based on the Normalized Cross Correlation between each small feature and the subset, then concatenates the bytes of each pixel to form a solid, color image
